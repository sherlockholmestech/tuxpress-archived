My friends and I run a programming discord community.  Frequently, we will deviate from the topic of programming  into something else, like music.  Whenever music is brought up though, 2 words will always pop up: Dimitri Shostakovich.  That is because the server owner and I both enjoy his works greatly.  I think now is the time to explain why we enjoy his works so much.
