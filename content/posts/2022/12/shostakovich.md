My friends and I run a programming discord community.  Frequently, we will deviate from the topic of programming  into something else, like music.  Whenever music is brought up though, 2 words will always pop up: Dimitri Shostakovich.  That is because the server owner and I both enjoy his works greatly.  I think now is the time to explain why we enjoy his works so much.

# His Early Life

Shostakovich was born in 1906 in Russia, just in time for the Russian Revolution, where we see the Bolsheviks (Russian: Большевики́) overthrow the Russian Empire.  During that period, new morden musical techniques from the east are still tolerated in the Soviet Union, and Shostakovich was greatly influenced by them.  Listen to this example from his 2nd Symphony:
