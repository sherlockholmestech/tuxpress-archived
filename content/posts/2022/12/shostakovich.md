My friends and I run a programming discord community.  Frequently, we will deviate from the topic of programming into something else, like music.  Whenever music is brought up though, 2 words will always pop up: Dimitri Shostakovich.  That is because the server owner and I both enjoy his works greatly.  I think now is the time to explain why we enjoy his works so much.

# His Early Life

Shostakovich was born in 1906 in Russia, just in time for the Russian Revolution, where we see the Bolsheviks (Russian: Большевики́) overthrow the Russian Empire.  During that period, new morden musical techniques from the east are still tolerated in the Soviet Union, and Shostakovich was greatly influenced by them.  Listen to this example from his 2nd Symphony:

However, after the revolution, the authorities became less and less tolarant of western culture, and the offical art form of the Soviet Union was announced: Socialist Realism.  This limitation on artistic expression forced artists and composers to create music deemed “suitable for the party” and all content published had to be approved by the authorities.  This harsh limitation caused Shostakovich to hide double meaning in many of his famous pieces.

# 7th Symphony

Jumping to WWII, it was just the end of the Battle of Lenningrad, and the people of the Soviet Union were feeling particularly patriotic.  Hence, the 7th symphony was written.  You can listen to the entire thing here:

This piece, which was approved by the authorities, became propaganda gold for the Soviet Union.  The listeners, however, thought that this what not only a critisism of the Nazi totalitarian government, it was also about any type of totalitarian government in the world, including the Soviet authorities.

# 9th Symphony

After falling in favour of the Soviet authorities, they decided to comission Shostakovich to compose an accompanying orchestral piece for the celebrations after the war.  Joseph Stalin wanted his 9th Symphony (as with most other 9th symphonies) to be great and majestic.  More heroic. More of everything possible that will push people's patriotism to their climax.  So, Shostakovich was faced with the dilemma of whether to deliver what the Soviet authorities wanted, or to do *a little bit* of trolling. Listen to what he wrote and you tell me: Is this suitable for a military celebration after the war?

Was your answer no?  Well then, you are correct!  It sounds chirpy and lively, not at all the serious for the event!  Also, look at the key.  E-flat major.  The key that is supposed to be the "Heroic Key".  However, its undermined by the silly sounding E minor chord on bar 4.

Also, there is the silly-sounding ba bumm... that tells us to expect heavy brasses and a climax, but instead leads to this chipy little tune.

Its very funny how he repeats the first part, like following an outdated sonata form.  Its like he is trying to say, "Look how hard I am trying!"

Then, he continues to taunt the audience with his ba bumm(s), like a child trying to finish a video game but keeps on failing on the last step.

All these aspects all cause it to sound more like a joke than anything serious.
